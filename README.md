# dog-cat-api-discord-bot
This is a extremely low effort discord bot i made out of boredom that sends an absolutely random cat or dog gif/picture using api

this is a python project

install the discord python module in order to use this in cmd

this is my second time i upload to github and i dont know how to use it so excuse me if this is looking bad
